*Fight against Zombies, Creepers and Skeletons in GTA V!*
This mod spawns Zombies, Creepers and Skeletons during night time in GTA V. 
>Zombies just attack you with their fist. They spawn every second.
>Creepers are portrayed through the Jay Norris character model and always run towards you and explode if they are in a radius of 6 meters of you. They spawn every 5 seconds.
>Skeletons are portrayed through the Jesus character model and are equiped with a firework launcher(this kills you in two shots). They spawn every 10 seconds and tries to shoot at you every second. (Sometimes they attack other mobs🤷‍♂️)
